Test the differentiability of the function f(x) = |x - 2| at x = 2. 
Solution 
We know that this function is continuous at x = 2.
But {{<katex>}}{f}'=\lim\frac{fx-f(2)}{x-2}=\lim\frac{|x-2|-0}{x-2}=\lim\frac{|x-2|}{x-2}=\lim\frac{-(x-2)}{x-2}=-1{{</katex>}}
Suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of motion s = f(t), where 
s is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from the origin at time t. The function f that 
describes the motion is called the position function of the object. In the time interval from t = t
0
 to 
t = t
0
 + Dt, the change in position is f(t
0
 + Dt) - f(t
0
). The average velocity over this time interval is
