# A recall of basic results

In earlier classes, we have learnt trigonometric ratios using a right triangle and proved trigonometric
identities for an acute angle. One wonders, how the distance between planets, heights of Mountains,
distance between far off objects like Earth and Sun, heights of tall buildings, the speed of supersonic
jets are measured or calculated. Interestingly, such distances or heights are calculated applying
the trigonometric ratios which were derived for acute angles. Our aim is to develop trigonometric
functions defined for any real number and use them in all branches of mathematics, in particular, in
calculus. First, let us recall the definition of angle and degree measure of an angle

3.2.1 **Angles**

The angle AOB is a measure formed by two rays A
and OB sharing the common point O as shown in the
Figure 3.1. The common point O is called the vertex of the
angle. If we rotate the ray OA about its vertex O and takes
the position OB, then OA and OB respectively are called
the initial side and the terminal side of the angle produced.
An anticlockwise rotation generates a positive angle (angle
with positive sign), while a clockwise rotation generates a
negative angle (angle with negative sign).

One full anticlockwise (or clockwise) rotation of OA back
to itself is called one **complete** **rotation** **or** **revolution**.

3.2.2  **Different Systems of measurement of angle**

Different Systems of measurement of angle
There are three different systems for measuring angles.
(i) Sexagesimal system
The **Sexagesimal** **system** is the most prevalent system of measurement where a right angle
is divided into 90 equal parts called Degrees. Each degree is divided into 60 equal parts called
Minutes, and each minute into 60 equal parts called Seconds.
The symbols 1◦, {{< katex >}}1^{1} {{< /katex >}}and {{< katex >}}1^{9} {{< /katex >}}are used to denote a degree, a **minute** and a **second** respectively.



(ii) Centesimal system
In the **Centesimal** **system** , the right angle is divided into 100 equal parts, called **Grades**;
each grade is subdivided into 100 Minutes, and each minute is subdivided into 100 Seconds.
The symbol  {{< katex >}}1^{9} {{< /katex >}}is used to denote a grade.
(iii) Circular system
In the circular system , the radian measure of an angle is introduced using arc lengths
in a circle of radius r. Circular system is used in all branches of Mathematics and in other
applications in Science. The symbol {{< katex >}}1{c} {{< /katex >}}is used to denote 1 radian measure.

3.2.3 **Degree Measure**

The degree is a unit of measurement of angles and is represented by the symbol ◦. In degrees, we split up one complete rotation into 360 equal parts, and each part is one degree, denoted by 1 ◦. Thus, 1 ◦ is 1/360 of one complete rotation. 

To measure a fraction of an angle and for accuracy of measurement of angles, **minutes** and **seconds** are introduced. One minute (10 ) corresponds to 1/60 of a degree, and in turn, a second (100) corresponds to 1/60 of a minute or 1/3600 of a degree. 

We shall classify a pair of angles in the following way for better understanding and usages:
(i) Two angles that have the exact same measure are called congruent angles.
(ii) Two angles that have their measures adding to 90◦ are called complementary angles.
(iii) Two angles that have their measures adding to 180◦ are called supplementary angles.
(iv) Two angles between 0 ◦ and 360◦ are conjugate if their sum equals 360◦.

(i) The concept of degrees, minutes, and seconds is analogous to the system of time measurement, where we think of a degree representing one hour. 
(ii) Observe that 59.0854◦ = 59◦ + 0.0854◦
    0.0854◦ = .0854◦ × 60
    1 ◦ = 5.1240
    5.1240 = 50 + 0.1240
    0.1240 = 0.1240 × 60
    1 0 = 7.4400
    Thus, 59.0854◦ = 59◦ 5' 7.4400"
(iii) Also notice that 34◦ 51' 35" = 34.8597◦
    and 90◦ − 36◦ 18' 47" = 53◦ 41' 13"
   
 **3.2.4 Angles in Standard Position**
   
 An angle is said to be in **standard position** if its
vertex is at the origin and its initial side is along the
positive x-axis. An angle is said to be in the first
quadrant, if in the standard position, its terminal
side falls in the first quadrant. Similarly, we can
define for the other three quadrants. Angles in
standard position having their terminal sides along
the x-axis or y-axis are called quadrantal angles.
Thus, 0◦, 90◦, 180◦, 270◦and 360◦are **quadrantalangles**.
The degree measurement of a quadrantal angle is a multiple of 90◦.

The degree measurement of a quadrantal angle is a multiple of 90◦

**3.2.5 Coterminal angles**

One complete rotation of a ray in the anticlockwise direction results in an angle measuring of 360◦
. By continuing
the anticlockwise rotation, angles larger than 360◦
can be
produced. If we rotate in clockwise direction, negative
angles are produced. Angles 57◦
, 417◦
and −303◦ have
the same initial side and terminal side but with different
amount of rotations, such angles are called coterminal
angles. Thus, angles in standard position that have the
same terminal sides are coterminal angles . Hence, if α and
β are coterminal angles, then β = α + k(360◦
), k is an
integer. The measurements of coterminal angles differ by
an integral multiple of 360◦
.
For example, 417◦
and −303◦
are coterminal because
417◦ − (−303◦
) = 720◦ = 2 (360◦
).

(i) Observe that 45◦
, −315◦
and 405◦
lie in the first quadrant.

(ii) The following pairs of angles are coterminal angles (30◦
, 390◦
); (280◦
, 1000◦
) and
(−85◦
, 275◦
).

**3.2.6 Basic Trigonometric ratios using a right triangle**

We know that six ratios can be formed using the three lengths a, b, c
of sides of a right triangle ABC. Interestingly, these ratios lead to the
definitions of six basic trigonometric functions.
First, let us recall the trigonometric ratios which are defined with
reference to a right triangle.

 {{< katex >}}sin θ = opposite side / hypotenuse {{< /katex >}}
;
 {{< katex >}}cos θ = adjacent side / hypotenuse {{< /katex >}}

Let us list out the values of trigonometric functions at known angles.

| Angle (degrees) | sin(angle) | cos(angle) | tan(angle) |
|-----------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 0               | 0          | 1          | 0          |
| 30              | 1/2        | √3/2       | 1/√3       |
| 45              | √2/2       | √2/2       | 1          |
| 60              | √3/2       | 1/2        | √3         |
| 90              | 1          | 0          | ∞          |


(i) The values given above are all exact.

(ii) We observe that sin 30° = cos 60° and sin 60° = cos 30°.

(iii) The value of reciprocal ratios namely cosecant, secant, and cotangent can be obtained using the above table.

(iv) The result cos 90° = 0 does not allow us to define tan 90° and sec 90°.

(v) Similarly sin 0° = 0 does not permit us to define cosec 0° and cot 0°.

**3.2.8 Basic Trigonometric Identities**

A trigonometric identity represents a relationship that is always true for all admissible values in the domain. For example, {{< katex >}}\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} {{< /katex >}} is true for all admissible values of {{< katex >}}\theta{{< /katex >}}. Hence, this is an identity. However,  {{< katex >}}\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} {{< /katex >}} is not an identity, since the relation fails when  {{< katex >}}\theta = 60^\circ {{< /katex >}}. Identities enable us to simplify complicated expressions. They are the basic tools of trigonometry which are being used in solving trigonometric equations. The most important part of working with identities is to manipulate them with the help of a variety of techniques from algebra.

Let us recall the fundamental identities (Pythagorean identities) of trigonometry, namely:
   {{< katex >}}\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 {{< /katex >}}
    {{< katex >}}\sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta = 1 {{< /katex >}}
    {{< katex >}}\csc^2 \theta - \cot^2 \theta = 1 {{< /katex >}}

(i) {{< katex >}}\sin^2 \theta{{< /katex >}} is the commonly used notation for {{< katex >}}(\sin \theta)^2{{< /katex >}}, likewise for other trigonometric ratios.
(ii) {{< katex >}}\sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta = 1{{< /katex >}} is meaningless when {{< katex >}}\theta = 90^\circ{{< /katex >}}. But still, it is an identity and true for all values of {{< katex >}}\theta{{< /katex >}} for which {{< katex >}}\sec \theta{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}\tan \theta{{< /katex >}} are defined. Thus, an identity is an equation that is true for all values of its domain values.
(iii) When we write {{< katex >}}\frac{\sin \theta}{1 + \cos \theta}{{< /katex >}}, we understand that the expression is valid for all values of {{< katex >}}\theta{{< /katex >}} for which {{< katex >}}1 + \cos \theta \neq 0{{< /katex >}}.

**Example 3.1: Prove that**

 {{< katex >}}\frac{\tan \theta + \sec \theta - 1}{\tan \theta - \sec \theta + 1} = \frac{1 + \sin \theta}{\cos \theta}{{< /katex >}}

**Solution:**

{{< katex >}}\frac{\tan \theta + \sec \theta - 1}{\tan \theta - \sec \theta + 1} = \frac{\tan \theta + \sec \theta -}{...} {{</ katex >}}


{{< katex >}} \frac{\tan \theta + \sec \theta - 1}{\tan \theta - \sec \theta + 1} = \frac{\tan \theta + \sec \theta -}{cos θ} {{</ katex >}}

**Example 3.2 Prove that**

 (sec A − cosecA) (1 + tan A + cot A) = tan A sec A − cot A cosecA.

 {{< katex >}}\text{L.H.S.} = (\frac{1}{\cos A} - \frac{1}{\sin A} \left) [1 + \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} + \frac{\cos A}{\sin A}\right] {{< / katex >}}

 
 = {{< katex >}}\frac{\sin^3 A - \cos^3 A}
 {\sin^2 A \cos^2 A}  {{< /katex >}}


R.H.S. = {{< katex >}}\frac{\sin A}{\cos^2 A} - \frac{\cos A}{\sin^2 A} = \frac{\sin^3 A - \cos^3 A}{\sin^2 A \cos^2 A}  {{< /katex >}}

From (i) and (ii), we get the required result.


**Example 3.3: Eliminate θ from {{< katex >}} \cos \theta = b{{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}} \sin \theta = d{{< /katex >}}, where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\) are constants.**

**Solution:**

Squaring and adding the equations {{< katex >}}\cos \theta = bc {{< /katex >}}and {{< katex >}} \sin \theta = ad{{< /katex >}}, we get:

{{< katex >}}a^2c^2 = b^2c^2 + a^2d^2 {{< /katex >}}

6. (i) {{< katex >}} {sin^4 \alpha} + {sin^4 \beta } {{< /katex >}} = {{< katex >}}2{sin^2 \alpha}{sin^2 \beta }{{</ katex >}}
   (ii) {{< katex >}} \frac{cos^4 \beta}{cos^2 \alpha } + \frac{sin^4 \beta}{sin^2 \alpha } = 1 {{</ katex >}}

 # Radian Measure

 Initially right triangles were used to define trigonometric ratios and angles were
measured in degrees. But right triangles have limitations as they involve only
acute angles. In degrees a full rotation corresponds to 360◦ where the choice of
360 was made thousands of years prior to the Babylonians. They might have application of
chosen 360 based on the number of days in a year. But it does have the nice
property of breaking into smaller angles like 30◦
, 45◦
, 60◦
, 90◦
and 180◦
. In 17th century,
trigonometry was extended to Physics and Chemistry where it required trigonometric functions
whose domains were sets of real numbers rather than angles. This was accomplished by using
correspondence between an angle and length of the arc on a unit circle. Such a measure of angle is
termed as radian measure . For theoretical applications, the radian is the most common system of
angle measurement. Radians are common unit of measurement in many technical fields, including
calculus. The most important irrational number π plays a vital role in radian measures of angles. Let
us introduce the radian measure of an angle.
9
Definition 3.1
The radian measure of an angle is the ratio of the arc length it
subtends, to the radius of the circle in which it is the central
angle.
Consider a circle of radius r. Let s be the arc length
subtending an angle θ at the centre

Then, θ = {{< katex >}}\frac{arc length}{radius}{{< /katex >}} ={{< katex >}}\frac{s}{r}{{</ katex >}} radians. Hence, s = rθ.

1. All circles are similar. Thus, for a given central angle in any circle, the ratio of the intercepted arc length to the radius is always constant.

2. When \( s = r \), we have an angle of 1 radian. Thus, one radian is the angle made at the centre of a circle by an arc with length equal to the radius of the circle.

3. Since the lengths \( s \) and \( r \) have the same unit,  {{< katex >}} \theta  {{< /katex >}} is unitless, and thus, we do not use any notation to denote radians.

4.  {{< katex >}} \theta = 1 {{< /katex >}} radian measure if \( s = r \).
    {{< katex >}}\theta = 2  {{</ katex >}}radian measure if \( s = 2r \).
   Thus, in general  {{< katex >}} \theta = k {{< /katex >}} radian measure if \( s = kr \).
   Hence, radian measure of an angle tells us how many radius lengths we need to sweep out along the circle to subtend the angle  {{< katex >}}\theta  {{< /katex >}}.

5. Radian angle measurement can be related to the edge of the unit circle. In the radian system, we measure an angle by measuring the distance traveled along the edge of the unit circle to where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.


# Relationship between Degree and Radian Measures

We have degree and radian units to measure angles. One measuring unit is better than another if it can
be defined in a simpler and more intuitive way. For example, in measuring temperature, Celsius unit
is better than Fahrenheit as Celsius was defined using 0
◦
and 100◦
for freezing and boiling points of
water. Radian measure is better for conversion and calculations. Radian measure is more convenient
for analysis whereas degree measure of an angle is more convenient to communicate the concept
between people. Greek Mathematicians observed the relation of π which arises from circumference
of a circle and thus, π plays a crucial role in radian measure.
In unit circle, a full rotation corresponds to 360◦ whereas, a full rotation is related to 2π radians,
the circumference of the unit circle. Thus, we have the following relations:

2π radians = 360◦
, which reduces to π radians = 180◦
.

Thus, 1 radian = {{< katex >}}(\frac{180}{\pi })^◦{{< /katex >}} or 1
◦ {{< katex >}}\frac{\pi}{180}{{< /katex >}}
radians.

x radian = {{< katex >}} (\frac{180x}{\pi }) {{< /katex >}} or x◦ {{< katex >}}\frac{\pi x}{180x}{{< /katex >}}

Observe that the scale used in radians is much smaller than the scale in degrees. The smaller scale
makes the graphs of trigonometric functions more visible and usable. The above relation gives a way
to convert radians into degrees or degrees into radians.

(i) The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is always a constant. This
constant is denoted by the irrational number π.

(ii) Mark a point P on a unit circle and put the unit circle on the number line so that P
touches the number 0. Allow the circle to roll along the number line. The point P will
touch the number 2π on the number line when the circle rolls to one complete revolution
to the right.

(iii) If the unit of angle measure is not specified, then the angle is understood to be in radians.

(iv) Consider a sector of a circle with radius r. If θ is the central angle of the sector, then

The area of the sector can be expressed as:

{{< katex >}}
\text{Area of the sector} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{\pi r^2}{360^\circ} \cdot \theta \quad & \text{in degree measure} \\


\frac{\pi r^2}{2\pi} \cdot \theta \quad & =\frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta \quad & \text{in radian measure (simplified)}\\

   \end{cases}
{{</ katex >}}

Clearly, the calculation in radian measure is much easier to work with.

1. The values of{{< katex >}} \pi {{< /katex >}} and {{< katex >}}\frac{22}{7} {{</ katex >}}correct to four decimal places are 3.1416 and 3.1429 respectively. Thus, {{< katex >}} \pi {{</ katex >}} and {{< katex >}}\frac{22}{7} {{</ katex >}} are approximately equal correct up to two decimal places. Hence, {{< katex >}} \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} {{< /katex >}}.

2. {{< katex >}}\( 1 \) radian is approximately equal to \( 57^\circ1704500 \), and \( 1^\circ \) is approximately equal to \( 0.017453 \) radians.
   - \( 1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180} \times 60 \) radians ≈ \( 0.000291 \) radians.
   - \( 1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180} \times 60 \times 60 \) radians ≈ \( 0.000005 \) radians.
{{</ katex >}}
3. The radian measures and the corresponding degree measures for some known angles are given in the following table:

   | Radians | \(0\) | \(1\) | \(0.017453\) | \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) | \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) | \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) | \(2\pi\) |
   |---------|------|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
   | Degrees | \(0^\circ\) | \(57^\circ1704500\) | \(1^\circ\) | \(30^\circ\) | \(45^\circ\) | \(60^\circ\) | \(90^\circ\) | \(180^\circ\) | \(270^\circ\) | \(360^\circ\) |

4. {{< katex >}}\sin(90^\circ) = 1 {{</ katex >}}, but {{< katex >}} \sin(90) \neq 1 {{</ katex >}}(in radian measure).
