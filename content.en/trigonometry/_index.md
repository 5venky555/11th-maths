# Trigonometry

*“When I trace at my pleasure the windings to and fro of the heavenly bodies,
I no longer touch the earth with my feet”*

**Ptolemy**


Trigonometry is primarily a branch of Mathematics that studies relationship 
involving sides and angles of triangles. The word trigonometry stems from 
the Greek word trigonon which means triangle and metron which means to 
measure. So, literally trigonometry is the study of measuring triangles. Greek 
mathematicians used trigonometric ratios to determine unknown distances. The 
Egyptians on the other hand used a primitive form of trigonometry for building 
Pyramids in second millinium BC(BCE). Aristarchus (310-250 BC(BCE)) used 
trigonometry to determine the distances of Moon and Sun. 
Eratosthenes (276-195 BC(BCE)) was t he f irst p erson to c alculate th

Ptolemy of Alexandaria (AD(CE) 90-168) standard unit of measurement during that 
period. The general principles of Trigonometry were formulated by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus 
(190-120 BC(BCE)) and he is credited as the founder of trigonometry. His ideas were used by Ptolemy of 
Alexandria (AD 90-168) leading to the development of Ptolemy theory of Astronomy. The most significant 
development of Trigonometry in ancient times was in India. Indian Mathematician and Astronomer 
Aryabhata (AD(CE) 476-550) defined sine, cosine, inverse cosine, inverse sine and he gave mathematical 
results in the form of 108 verses which included a formula for the area of a triangle.Mathematicians 
Brahmagupta (598 AD(CE)), Bhaskara I (600 AD(CE)) and Bhaskara II (1114 AD(CE)) are other 
Ancient Indians who contributed significantly to develop Trigonometry. Trigonometry was developed as a 
separate branch of Mathematics through the works of Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748) and Leonhard Euler 
(1707-1783). Euler established the fundamental results connecting trigonometric functions and complex 
exponential. Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) made important contribution to the study of trigonometric series. 
His invention of Fourier series has a wide range of applications especially in vibration analysis, electrical 
engineering, acoustics, optics, signal processing, image processing and quantum mechanics. In modern 
times, trigonometric functions are developed as mathematical functions of angular magnitudes, through the 
medium of which many kinds of geometrical and algebraic investigations are carried out in every branch 
of Mathematics and applications. Our GPS system in cars and mobile phones is based on trigonometric 
calculations. Advanced medical scanning procedures such as CT and MRI, used in detecting tumors, 
involve sine and cosine functions.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this chapter, students are expected to know
• the limitations of right triangle trigonometric ratios as they involve acute angles.
• the necessity for the study of radian measure of an angle and its advantage over degree
measure.
• how unit circle is used to define trigonometric functions of real numbers.
• various trigonometric identities, their relationships and applications.
• the principal solution and general solution of a trigonometric equation.
• how to solve trigonometric equations.
• law of sines, law of cosines in triangles and their applications in real life situations.
• how to solve an oblique triangle using law of sines and law of cosines.
• application of Heron’s formula and how to compute area of a triangle without finding its
altitude.
• the existence of inverse trigonometric functions and their domains and ranges

Let us recall the basics of trigonometric ratios using acute angles and their properties, which were
discussed in earlier classes.
