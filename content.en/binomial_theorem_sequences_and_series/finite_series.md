# 5.5 Finite Series

Roughly speaking a series is the sum of terms of a sequence of numbers; a
finite series is the sum of terms of a finite sequence of numbers. If (an) is a
sequence of numbers, then the expression a1 + a2 + · · · + an is called a finite
series. The expression a1 + a2 + · · · + an is denoted as nΣk=1ak. Sometimes,
depending upon the problem under consideration and for simplicity a series
may be given as a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · with first term as a0.

**5.5.1 Sum of Arithmetic, Geometric and Arithmetico-Geometric Progressions**

In the earlier classes we studied about the sum of a few terms, like sum of first n terms, of arithmetic
and geometric progressions. We now recall them.

**Sum of Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions**

• A series is said to be an arithmetic series if the terms of the series form an arithmetic sequence.
A series is said to be a geometric series if the terms of the series form a geometric sequence.

• The sum Sn of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence (a + (n − 1)d) is given by
Sn = na +(n−1)n2d =n2[2a + (n − 1)d].

• The sum Sn of the first n terms of the geometric sequence (arn−1) is given by Sn =a(1−rn)1−r
provided r 6= 1. If r = 1, then the sequence is nothing but the constant sequence a, a, a, . . . and the sum of the first n terms is clearly na. Thus, if r 6= 1, then 1 + r + r2 + · · · + rn−1 =1−rn1−r.

**Sum of Arithmetico-Geometric Progressions**

• A series is said to be an arithmetico-Geometric series if the terms of the series form an arithmetico-Geometric sequence.

• The sum Sn of the first n terms of the arithmetico-Geometric sequence ((a + (n − 1)d)r n−1) is given by
Sn =a − (a + (n − 1)d)r<sup>n/1 − r+ dr(1 − r<sup> n−1/(1 − r)<sup>2)

for r = 1

**5.5.3 Some Special Finite Series**
In this section we give some of the important formulas of summing up finitely many terms which
follows either an AP, GP, or any specific series.
1. Summation of first n natural numbers:
n
Σ
k=1
k = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n =
n(n + 1)
2
.
[Treating this as an AP, one can find the sum.]
2. Summation of the squares of first n natural numbers:
{{<katex>}}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i{{</katex>}}
nΣ
k=1
k
2 = 12 + 22 + 32 + · · · + n
2 =
n(n + 1)(2n + 1)

[Use the identity a

) and try to prove this result.]
3. Summation of the cubes of first n natural numbers:
n
Σ
k=1
k
3 = 13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + n

n(n + 1)
2

[Use the identity k
4 − (k − 1)4 = (4k
3 − 6k
2 + 4k − 1) and try to prove this result.]
Note that the above three results were proved in the earlier classes.
