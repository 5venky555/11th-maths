# Absolute Value

2.3.1 Definition and Properties

As we have observed that there is an order preserving one-to-one correspondence between elements
of R and points on the number line. Note that for each x ∈ R, x and −x are equal distance from the
origin. The distance of the number a ∈ R from 0 on the number line is called the absolute value of
the number a and is denoted by |a|. Thus, for any x ∈ R, we have
|x| =

x if x ≥ 0,
−x if x < 0.
and hence | · | defines a function known as absolute value function, from R onto [0, ∞) and the graph
of this function is discussed in Chapter 1.

Basic Algebra
(i) For any x ∈ R, we have |x| = | − x| and thus, |x| = |y| if and only if x = y or
x = −y.
(ii) |x − a| = r if and only if r ≥ 0 and x − a = r or x − a = −r.
2.3.2 Equations Involving Absolute Value
Note that a real number a is said to be a solution of an equation or an inequality, if the statement
obtained after replacing the variable by a is true.
Next we shall learn solving equations involving absolute value.
Example 2.1 Solve |2x − 17| = 3 for x.
Solution:
|2x − 17| = 3. Then, we have 2x − 17 = ±3 which implies x = 10 or x = 7.
Example 2.2 Solve 3|x − 2| + 7 = 19 for x.
Solution:
3|x − 2| + 7 = 19. So that we have, |x − 2| =
19−7
3 = 4.
Thus, we have either x − 2 = 4 or x − 2 = −4.
Therefore the solutions are x = −2 and x = 6.
Example 2.3 Solve |2x − 3| = |x − 5|.
Solution:
We know that |u| = |v| if and only if u = v or u = −v.
Therefore, |2x − 3| = |x − 5| implies 2x − 3 = x − 5 or 2x − 3 = 5 − x.
Solving these two equations, we get x = −2 and x =

Hence, both x = −2 and x =

are solutions.
2.3.3 Some Results For Absolute Value
(i) If x, y ∈ R, |y + x| = |x − y|, then xy = 0.
(ii) For any x, y ∈ R, |xy| = |x||y|.

(iv) For any x, y ∈ R, |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|.
2.3.4 Inequalities Involving Absolute Value
Here we shall learn to solve inequalities involving absolute values. First we analyze very simple
inequalities such as (i) |x| < r and (ii) |x| > r.
(i) Let us prove that |x| < r if and only if −r < x < r. Note that r > 0 as |x| ≥ 0.
There are two possibilities to consider depending on the sign of x.
Case (1). If x ≥ 0, then |x| = x, so |x| < r implies x < r.
Case (2). If x < 0, then |x| = −x, so |x| < r implies −x < r that is, x > −r.
Therefore we have, |x| < r if and only if −r < x < r, that is x ∈ (−r, r).

2.4 Linear Inequalities
(ii) Let us prove that |x| > r if and only if x < −r or x > r.
Consider |x| > r. If r < 0, then every x ∈ R satisfies the inequality.
For r ≥ 0, there are two possibilities to consider.
Case (1). If x ≥ 0, then |x| = x > r.
Case (2). If x < 0, then |x| = −x > r, that is, x < −r.
So we have |x| > r, if and only if x < −r or x > r, that is, x ∈ (−∞, −r) ∪ (r, ∞).
Remark:
(i) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≤ r if and only if −r ≤ x − a ≤ r if and only if x ∈ [a − r, a + r].
(ii) For any a ∈ R, |x − a| ≥ r is equivalent to x − a ≤ −r or x − a ≥ r if and only if
x ∈ (−∞, a − r] ∪ [a + r, ∞).
Example 2.4 Solve |x − 9| < 2 for x.
Solution:
|x − 9| < 2 implies −2 < x − 9 < 2. Thus, 7 < x < 11.
Example 2.5 Solve

x − 4

> 1, x 6= 4.
> Solution:
> From the given inequality, we have that 2 > |x − 4|.
> That is, −2 < x − 4 < 2 and x 6= 4.
> Adding 4 throughout the inequality, we obtain 2 < x < 6 and x 6= 4.
> So the solution set is (2, 4) ∪ (4, 6).
