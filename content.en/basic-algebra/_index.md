# Introduction

Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which one expresses relations among quantities by using
symbols to represent these quantities. The symbols are called the variables. In this class we shall allow
the variables to represent real numbers only. One can carry out manipulations and computations using
variables just as one does with numbers. That is, one may substitute real numbers for the variables in
the expression and the resulting value will also be a real number. Once a quantity or a mathematical
statement is expressed in terms of variables, it is possible to substitute specific numerical values for
those variables. This makes algebra a very powerful tool. For this reason the subject of algebra has
very wide application, not only within mathematics, but also in other disciplines and in real life. The
notion of real numbers is fundamental to the whole of mathematics. The real number system was well
understood only in the nineteenth century. The need for extending the rational numbers arose quite
early in the history of mathematics. Pythagoreans knew that 2 was not a rational number. Certain
constructions involving irrational numbers can be found in Shulbha Sutras, which date back to
around 800 BC(BCE). Aryabhata (476-550) had found approximations to π.
Indian mathematicians like Brahmagupta (598-670) and Bhaskaracharya
(1114-1185) had made contributions to the understanding of the real
numbers system and algebra. In his work Brahmagupta had solved
the general quadratic equation for both positive and negative roots.
Bhaskaracharya solved quadratic equations with more than one unknown
and found negative and irrational solutions. The most important real
number zero was the contribution by Indians.
Rene Descartes (1596-1650) introduced the term “real” to describe
roots of a polynomial distinguishing them from imaginary ones. A rigorous construction of real number system was due to Richard Dedekind
(1831-1916).
