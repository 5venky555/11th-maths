# Linear Inequalities

Recall that a function of the form f(x) = ax + b, a, b ∈ R are constants, is called a linear function,
because its graph is a straight line. Here a is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. If a {{< katex >}} \neq {{< /katex >}} 0, then x-intercept x = {{< katex >}} \frac{-b}{a} {{< /katex >}} is obtained by solving f(x)= ax + b = 0.

But there are situations where we need to consider linear inequalities.

For example to describe a statement like “ A tower is not taller than fifty feet.”
If x denotes the height of the tower in feet, then the above statement can be expressed as x ≤ 50.

**Example 2.6** Our monthly electricity bill contains a basic charge, that is independent of units
consumed and a charge that depends on the units consumed. Let us say Electricity Board charges
Rs.110 as basic charge and charges Rs. 4 for each unit we use. If a person wants to keep his
electricity bill below Rs.250, then what should be his electricity usage?

Solution:

Let x denote the number of units used. Note that x ≥ 0. Then, his electricity bill is Rs. 110 + 4x.
The person wants his bill to be below Rs.250. Let us solve the inequality 110 + 4x < 250. Thus,
4x < 140; which gives 0 ≤ x < 35.
The person should keep his usage below 35 units in order to keep his bill below Rs.250.

**Example 2.7** Solve 3x − 5 ≤ x + 1 for x.

Solution:

We have 3x − 5 ≤ x + 1; which is equivalent to 2x ≤ 6. Hence we have x ≤ 3; the solution set is
(−∞, 3].

We can also solve the above inequality graphically.
Let us consider the graphs of f(x) = 3x − 5 and g(x) = x + 1 (See Figure 2.3). Now,
find all the x-values for which the graph of f is below the graph of g.

**Example 2.8** Solve the following system of linear inequalities.
3x − 9 ≥ 0, 4x − 10 ≤ 6.

Solution:

Note that 3x − 9 ≥ 0 implies 3x ≥ 9, by multiplying both sides by 1/3 we get x ≥ 3. Similarly,
4x − 10 ≤ 6 implies 4x ≤ 16 and hence x ≤ 4.
So the solution set of 3x−9 ≥ 0, 4x−10 ≤ 6 is the intersection of [3, ∞) and (−∞, 4]. Clearly,
the intersection of these intervals give [3, 4].

**Example 2.9** A girl A is reading a book having 446 pages and she has already finished reading 271
pages. She wants to finish reading this book within a week. What is the minimum number of pages
she should read per day to complete reading the book within a week?

Solution:

Let x denote the number of pages the girl should read per day. Then we need our x to satisfy
7x + 271 ≥ 446. Hence x ≥ 25; which implies that she should read at least 25 pages per day.
In all the above examples observe that each inequality has more than one solution. Inequalities in
general give rise to a range of solutions.

5. To secure A grade one must obtain an average of 90 marks or more in 5 subjects each of maximum
   100 marks. If one scored 84, 87, 95, 91 in first four subjects, what is the minimum mark one scored
   in the fifth subject to get A grade in the course?

6. A manufacturer has 600 litres of a 12 percent solution of acid. How many litres of a 30 percent
   acid solution must be added to it so that the acid content in the resulting mixture will be more than
   15 percent but less than 18 percent?

7. Find all pairs of consecutive odd natural numbers both of which are larger than 10 and their sum
   is less than 40.

8. A model rocket is launched from the ground. The height h reached by the rocket after t seconds
   from lift off is given by h(t) = {{< katex >}} -5t^{2} {{< /katex >}} +100t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 20. At what time the rocket is 495 feet above the ground?

9. A plumber can be paid according to the following schemes: In the first scheme he will be paid
   rupees 500 plus rupees 70 per hour, and in the second scheme he will be paid rupees 120 per hour.
   If he works x hours, then for what value of x does the first scheme give better wages?
10. A and B are working on similar jobs but their monthly salaries differ by more than Rs 6000. If B
    earns rupees 27000 per month, then what are the possibilities of A’s salary per month?
