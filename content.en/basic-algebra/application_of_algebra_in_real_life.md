# Application of Algebra in Real Life

Algebra is used in many aspects of life. Financial planning is an area in daily life where algebra is
used. Algebra concepts are used to calculate interest rates by bankers and as well as for calculating
loan repayments. They are used to predict growth of money. Physical fitness is another area where
calculations are made to determine the right amount of food intake for an individual taking into
consideration such as the height, body mass of the person etc. Doctors use algebra in measuring
drug dosage depending on age and weight of an individual. Architects depend on algebra to design
buildings while civil engineers use it to design roads, bridges and tunnels. Algebra is needed to convert
items to scale so that the structures designed have the correct proportions. It is used to programme
computers and phones . Let us see some examples. Because of the extra-ordinary range of sensitivity
of the human ear (a range of over 1000 million millions to one), it is useful to use logarithmic scale
to measure sound intensity over this range. The unit of measure decibel is named after the inventor of
the telephone Alexander Graham Bell.
If we know the population in the world today, the growth, which is rapid, can be measured by
approximating to an exponential function. The radioactive carbon-14 is an organism which decays
according to an exponential formula.

**Summary**

    • π and √p, where p is a prime number, are some irrational numbers.
    • |x − a| = r if and only if r ≥ 0 and x − a = ±r.
    • |x − a| ≤ r if and only if −r ≤ x − a ≤ r or a − r ≤ x ≤ a + r.
    • |x − a| > r implies x < a − r and x > a + r (or) x ∈ (−∞, a − r) ∪ (a + r, ∞)
    • inequalities, in general, have more than one solution.
    • The nature of roots of ax2 + bx + c = 0 is determined by the discriminant D = b
    2 − 4ac.
    • A real number a is a zero of a polynomial function f(x) if and only if (x − a) is a factor of
    f(x).
    • If degree of f(x) is less than the degree of g(x), then f(x)
    g(x)
    can be written as sum of its partial
    fractions.
    • In general exponential functions and logarithmic functions are inverse functions to each other.
