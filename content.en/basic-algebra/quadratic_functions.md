# Quadratic Functions

In earlier classes we have learnt that for any z ∈ R and n ∈ N, z
n = z · z ·
z · · · z (n-times).
A function of the form P(x) = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c ∈ R are constants
and a 6= 0, is called a quadratic function. If P(t) = 0 for some t ∈ R, then
we say t is a zero of P(x).

2.5.1 Quadratic Formula
Is it possible to write the general quadratic function P(x) = ax2+bx+c
in the form a(x − k)
2 + d? The answer is yes. We can do this by the
method called “completing the square.” We shall rewrite the function
P(x) as follows:
P(x) = ax2 + bx + c
= a

x
2 + 2x
b
2a

- c
  a
  
  = a

x
2 + 2x
b
2a

- 
  b
  2a
  2
  −
  b
  2
  4a
  2
- c
  a
  !
  = a
  
  x +
  b
  2a
  2
  − a
  b
  2
  4a
  2
- c
  = a
  
  x +
  b
  2a
  2
-

a

b
2a
2
− b
b
2a

- c
  !
  .
  Thus, P(x) = a
  
  x +
  b
  2a
  2
- P
  
  −b
  2a
  
  . (1)
  Now, to find the x- intercepts of the curve described by P(x), let us solve for P(x) = 0.
  Considering P(x) = 0 from (1) it follows that a
  
  x +
  b
  2a
  2
- P
