# Straight lines

Linear equations can be rewritten using the laws of elementary algebra into several different forms.

These equations are often referred to as the “equations of the straight line.”

 In the general form the linear equation is written as:

\\(ax + by + c = 0\\)

where *a* and *b* are not both equal to zero. The name “linear” comes from the fact that the set of
solutions of such an equation forms a straight line in the plane. In this chapter “line”, we mean a
straight line unless otherwise stated.

There are many ways to write the equation of a line which can all be converted from one to another by algebraic manipulation. These forms are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data are points, slope, and *intercepts*


**6.3.1 The relationship between the angle of inclination and slope**

**Definition 6.3**

**The angle of inclination** of a straight line is the
angle, say *θ*, made by the line with the *x*-axis
measured in the counter clockwise (positive)
direction.


Figure 6.13

**Definition 6.4**

**The slope** or gradient of a straight line is a number that measures its “direction and steepness”.

The slope of a line in the plane containing the x and y axes, is generally represented by the letter *m*.

It can be measured in many ways as given below:

(i) When *θ* is the angle of inclination of the line with the x-axis measured in the counter clockwise
direction then the slope


\\(m = \tan \theta.\\)

\\(When\:\theta\:is\: \dfrac{\pi }{2}, ⇒ m = \tan \dfrac{\pi }{2}\: is\:undefined.\\)

(ii) When *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* are any two points on the line with x\\(_2\\) != x\\(_1\\), then the slope is the change in the *y* coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the *x* coordinate.

This is described by the following equation.
\\(m=\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\dfrac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=\dfrac{vertical\:change}{horizontal\:change}\\)
Figure 6.14


(iii) When the general form of the linear equation *ax + by + c = 0* is given, then the slope of the
line is

\\(m=-\dfrac{a}{b},\:b\neq0\\)

\\(m\:is\: undefined\: when\: b\: =\: 0\\)

The slope of a line can be a positive or negative or zero or undefined as shown below:


Figure 6.15


**Definition 6.5**

In a plane three or more points are said to be collinear if they lie on a same straight line.

Let *A, B* and *C* be any three points on a plane. If the slope of *AB* is equal to the slope of *BC* (or *AC*), then they are collinear.


**Definition 6.6**

The **intercept** of a line is the point at which the line crosses either the *x*-axis or the *y*-axis.


The *x*-intercept is a point where the y value is zero, and the *y*-intercept is a point where the *x*-value is zero.

Therefore the intercepts of a line are the points where the line
intersects, or crosses, the horizontal and vertical axes.

Therefore it is clear that

(i) the equation of the *y*-axis is *x* = 0.

(ii) the equation of the *x*-axis is *y* = 0.

Figure 6.16

In the figure OA is the x-intercept and OB is the y-intercept.

Figure 6.17

We have learnt the definition and detailed information about the points, slope and intercepts. Using these information, let us recall the different forms of an equation of a straight line.

**6.3.3 Different Forms of an equation of a straight line**

Two conditions are sufficient to determine uniquely the equation of a straight line. Using the
combination of any two information from slope, intercepts and points, we can now form different
types of straight lines such as

(i) Slope and intercept form

(ii) Point and Slope form

(iii) The two Point form

(iv) Intercepts form and two more special types are

(v) Normal form

(vi) Parametric form


6.3 Straight Lines

Now let us look at an important way of describing the relationship between two quantities using the notion of a function.

(i) Slope and Intercept form

Proportional linear functions can be written in the form
y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. Non
proportional linear functions can be written in the form

\\(y\:=\:mx\:+\:b,\:\:b\neq0\\)

This is called the slope-intercept form of a straight line
because *m* is the slope and *b* is the *y*-intercept.

Figure 6.18

(1) when *b* = 0 and *m* != 0, the line passes through the origin and its equation is
*y = mx*.

(2) when *b* = 0 and *m* = 0, the line coincides with the *x*-axis and its equation is *y* = *0*.

(3) when *b* != 0 and *m* = 0, the line is parallel to the *x*-axis and its equation is *y* = *b*.



(ii) Point - Slope form:

Let *m* be the slope of the line and *A (x1, y1)* be the given
point on the line. Let *P (x, y)* be any point other than *A*
on the given line. Slope of the line joining *A (x1, y1)* and
*P (x, y)* is given by \\( m=\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}}\\)
\\(\Rightarrow {y-y_{1}}\:=\:m({x-x_{1}}),\\), (6.6)
which is known as point-slope form.

Figure 6.19

~~~
Since, the slope m is undefined for lines parallel to the y-axis, the point-slope
form of the equation will not give the equation of a line through A (x1, y1)
parallel to the y-axis. However, this presents no difficulty, since for any such
line the abscissa of any point on the line is x1. Therefore, the equation of such a
line is x = x1.
~~~ 

(iii) Two Points form


If *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* are any two points on the line with *x2 != x1* and *y1 != y2*, then the slope is  

\\( m=\dfrac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\)

The equation using point- slope form, we get 
\\( y-y_{1}=\dfrac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}(x-x_{1})\\)

Rewriting the above equation, we get


\\( \dfrac{y-y_{1}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}=\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\)

(6.7)


This equation is called two points form.


Two points form can also be represented in terms of the determinant as
\\( \begin{vmatrix}x-x_{1}
 &y-y_{1} \\ x_{2}-x_{1}
 & y_{2}-y_{1}
\end{vmatrix}=0.\\)

Figure 6.20


(iv) Intercepts form:

If the intercepts of a line on the *x*-axis and the *y*-axis
are known then the equation of the line can also be
found using intercepts. Suppose *x*-intercept *OA* = *a* and
*y*-intercept *OB = b*, where *a* and *b* are non-zero, then the
line passes through two points *A (a, 0)* and *B (0, b)* is

\\( \dfrac{y-0}{b-0}=\dfrac{x-a}{0-a}\\)
\\( \dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{b}=1\\)
(6.8)

The above equation is called an intercept form.

Figure 6.21


Lines that pass through the origin or which are horizontal or vertical or violate the nonzero condition on *a* or *b* cannot be represented in this form.

In most of the cases this form is used to draw the graph of the line in easy way.

(v) Normal form:

Let A and B be the intercepts made by the line.

Let *p* be the length of the normal *OP* drawn from the origin to a line *AB*, which makes an angle *α* with the *x*-axis.

\\(In\:right\:\Delta OPA,\dfrac{OP}{OA}=\cos\alpha \:and\\)
\\(In\:right\:\Delta OPB,\dfrac{OP}{OB}=\cos\dfrac{\pi }{2}-\alpha =\sin\alpha \\)
\\(\Rightarrow \dfrac{1}{OA}=\dfrac{\cos \alpha }{p}\\)
\\(and\:\dfrac{1}{OB}=\dfrac{\sin \alpha }{p}\\)
Using the above data in intercepts form

\\(\dfrac{x}{OA}+\dfrac{y}{OB}=1\\)
\\(We\:get,\:\dfrac{x\cos\alpha }{p}+\dfrac{y\sin\alpha }{p}=1\\)
\\(\Rightarrow x\cos \alpha +y\sin \alpha =p\\)
is called the normal form of equation.


Figure 6.22


If *p* is positive in all positions of the line and if *α* is always measured from *x*-axis in the
positive direction, this equation holds in every case as shown in the figure.


Figure 6.23


(vi) Parametric form:

Parametric equations of a straight line is of the form

\\(x=ar+x_{1}\:and\:y=br+y_{1}\\)
where *a* and *b* are constants and *r* is the parameter.


\\(\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{a}=\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{b}=r,\:(a\neq0,\:b\neq0).\\)

Suppose we have the equation of the line 
passing through the point *Q (x1, y1)* and making an angle *θ* with *x*-axis. Let *P (x, y)* be a
point on the line at a distance *r* from *Q*. Drop
perpendiculars *QN* and *PM* respectively from
*Q* and *P* to the *x*-axis and perpendicular *QR*
to *PM*.

From the right *∆QRP*

\\(x-x_{1}=QR=PQ\:\cos\theta=r\:\cos\theta\\)
Therefore
\\(\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{\cos\theta}=r\\)

Figure 6.24

Similarly, *y − y1 = RP = QP sinθ = r sinθ*
\\(\Rightarrow \dfrac{y-y_{1}}{\sin\theta}=r\\)
From (6.10) and (6.11) we get

\\(\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{\cos\theta}=\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{\sin\theta}=r\\)

where the parameter *r* is the distance between *(x1, y1)* and any point *(x, y)* on the line. This is
called the symmetric form or parametric form of the line.



___
The co-ordinates of any point on this line can be written as
 \\(x1 + r cos θ , y1 + r sin θ\\). Clearly coordinates of the point depend on the value 
 of r. This variable r is called parameter. Since r is a parameter the equations, 
 \\(x = x1 + r cos θ, y = y1 + r sin θ\\), is called the parametric equations of the line. 
 The value of \\('r'\\) is positive for all points lying on the line one side of the given 
 point and negative for all points lying on the line other side of the given point.
___

(vii) **The general form** of the equation of the straight line is

\\(ax+by+c=0,\\)
where *a*, *b* and *c* are all not zeros


The below table summarizes the types of straight lines related to the given information.


| S.No | Information Given                  | Euqation of the straight lines |
|------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | Slope(m) and y-intercept (b)       | \\(y=mx+b\\)              |
| 2    | Slope (m) and point (x1, y1)       | \\(y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})\\)           |
| 3    | Two points(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)    | \\(\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}=\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\\)                    |
| 4    | x-intercept (a) and y-intercept(b) | \\(\dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{b}=1\\)                           |
| 5    | Normal length (p), angle (α)       | \\(x\cos \alpha +y\sin \alpha =p\\)         |
| 6    | Parametric form: parameter-r       | \\(\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{\cos\theta}=\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{\sin\theta}=r\\)                         |
| 7    | The general equation               | \\(ax+by+c=0\\)              |




If we have two variable quantities, then each can be represented by a variable. If the rate of change of one variable with respect to the other variable is constant, then the relationship between them is linear.

In linear equation, the choice of one as independent and other as a dependent may represent the physical reality or may be convenient fiction. The independent variable is normally plotted on the horizontal axis *(x-axis)*, the dependent variable on the vertical axis *(y-axis)*. That is the values of *x* are always independent and *y* is dependent on those values of *x*.

The number scales on the two axes need not be the same. Indeed, in many applications different quantities are represented by *x* and *y*. For example, *x* may represent the number of mobile phones sold and y the total revenue resulting from the sales. In such cases it is often desirable to choose different number scales to represent the different quantities. However, that the zero of both number scales coincide at the origin of the two-dimensional coordinate system.

From the given information, to solve the problem using the concepts of straight lines, we have to select suitably one of the six equations given above.

**Example 6.7**
Find the slope of the straight line passing through the points (5,7) and (7,5). Also find
the angle of inclination of the line with the *x*-axis.


**Solution:**


Let *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* be (5,7) and (7,5) respectively. Let *θ* be
the angle of inclination of the line with the *x*-axis

Slope of the line
 \\(m\:=\:\dfrac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-y_{1}}=\dfrac{5-7}{7-5}=-1\\)


We know that \\(m=\tan\theta\\)
That is, \\(\tan\theta = −1 ⇒ \theta=\dfrac{3\pi}{4}\: or\: 135◦\\)

Slope and angle of inclination of the line with the x-axis are
respectively \\(m=−1\: and\:\theta=\dfrac{3\pi}{4}\\)

**Example 6.8** Find the equation of a straight line cutting an intercept of 5 from the negative direction of the *y*-axis and is inclined at an angle 150◦ to the *x*-axis.
**Solution:**
Given that the negative *y* intercept is 5 i.e., *b* = −5 and *θ* = 150◦

\\(m\:=\:\tan150\degree=\tan(180\degree-30\degree)=-tan30\degree=-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\\)
Slope and intercept form of the equation is \\(y\:=\:mx+b\\)

That is \\(y=-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}-5\\)
\\(x+\sqrt{3y}+5\sqrt{3}=0\\)

___

___
**Example 6.9** Show the points (0,-3/2),(1,-1) and (2,-1/2) are collinear.
Solution:
Let A, B and C be 
\\((0,-\dfrac{3}{2}),(1,-1)\:and\:(2,-\dfrac{1}{2})\\)
respectively.

The slope of *AB* is
\\(\dfrac{-1+\dfrac{3}{2}}{1-0}=\dfrac{1}{2}\\)

The slope of *BC* is
\\(\dfrac{-\dfrac{1}{2}+1}{2-1}=\dfrac{1}{2}\\)


Thus, the slope of *AB* is equal to slope of *BC*.

Hence, *A, B* and *C* are lying on the same line.


If the rate of change of one variable with respect to the other variable is constant, then
this constant rate of change can be taken as slope.(such as speed, constant increase or
constant decrease. . . ). Also equations of straight lines depend on the coordinate axes
how we define it. Thus in real world problems the equations are not necessarily identical
but the path and distance will always be the same.

**Example 6.10** The Pamban Sea Bridge is a railway bridge of length about 2065 *m* constructed
on the PalkStrait, which connects the Island town of Rameswaram to Mandapam, the main land of
India. The Bridge is restricted to a uniform speed of only 12.5 m/s. If a train of length 560 m starts
at the entry point of the bridge from Mandapam, then

(i) find an equation of the motion of the train.
(ii) when does the engine touch island
(iii) when does the last coach cross the entry point of the bridge
(iv) what is the time taken by a train to cross the bridge.


**Solution:** 

Let the *x*-axis be the time in seconds the *y*-axis be the distance
in metres. Let the engine be at the origin *O*. Therefore the length
of the train 560 m is the negative *y*-intercept.
The uniform speed 12.5 m/s is the slope of the motion of the
train. 
\\((speed=\dfrac{distance}{time})\\)

Since we are given slope and y-intercept, the equation of the
line is
\\(y\:=\:mx+b\\) (6.13)

Figure 6.27

(i) The equation of the motion of the train,
when \\(m=12.5\:and\:b=-560\\)
is \\(y\:=\:12.5x-560\\)
(ii) When the engine touches the other side of the bridge (island)
\\(y=2065\:and\:b\:=\:0\\)
\\(2065\:=\:12.5x\\)
\\(x\:=\:165.2seconds\\)
(iii) When *y* = 0, the last coach cross the entry point of the bridge,
\\(0\:=\:12.5x-560\\)
\\(x\:=\:44.8seconds\\)
(iv) When *y* = 2065, the time taken for the train to cross the other end of the bridge is given by
\\(2065\:=\:12.5x-560\\)
\\(x\:=\:210seconds\\)

(One may take the tail of the train as the origin and can find the equation of the straight line. It need not be identical with the above equation, but the path traced out by the train, distance, time, etc.,will be the same. Try it.)

**Example 6.11** Find the equations of the straight lines, making the *y*- intercept of 7 and angle
between the line and the *y*-axis is 30◦
**Solution:**

From the figure, it is clear that the two lines make the angles
60◦ and 120◦ with the x-axis

\\(Let\:m1\:be\: \tan60\degree\:=\:\sqrt{3}\:\:and\\)
\\(m2\:\:be\: \tan120\degree\:=\:\tan(180\degree-60\degree)=-\sqrt{3}\\)
\\(m1=\sqrt{3},m2=-\sqrt{3}\:and\:b=7\\)
Equations of lines are
\\(y=m_{1}x+b\:\:and\:\:b=7\\)
\\(y=\sqrt{3x}+7\:\:and\:\:y=-\sqrt{3}+7\\)

**Example 6.12** The seventh term of an arithmetic progression is 30 and tenth term is 21.

(i) Find the first three terms of an A.P.

(ii) Which term of the A.P. is zero (if exists)

(iii) Find the relation ship between Slope of the straight line and common difference of A.P.

**Solution:**

Since there is a constant increase or decrease in arithmetic progression, it is a linear function.

Let the *x*-axis be the number of the term and the *y*-axis be the value of the term.

Let *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* be (7,30) and (10,21) respectively, using the equation


\\(y-y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})\\) we get
\\(y-30=\dfrac{21-30}{10-7}(x-7)\\)
\\(y=-3x+51\\)
(i) Substituting *x* = 1, 2 and 3 in the equation (??) we get the first three terms of AP as 48, 45,
and 42.

(ii) Substituting *y* = 0 in equation (??) we get
\\(0=-3x+51\Rightarrow x=17.\\)
That is seventeenth term of A.P. is zero.

(iii) clearly the slope of the line −3 is equal to the common difference A.P.

From this example, slope of the line is equal to common difference of A.P. (Try to prove it)

**Example 6.13** The quantity demanded of a certain type of Compact Disk is 22,000 units when a
unit price is | 8. The customer will not buy the disk, at a unit price of | 30 or higher. On the other
side the manufacturer will not market any disk if the price is | 6 or lower. However, if the price
| 14 the manufacturer can supply 24,000 units. Assume that the quantity demanded and quantity
supplied are linearly proportional to the price. Find (i) the demand equation (ii) supply equation
(iii) the market equilibrium quantity and price. (iv) The quantity of demand and supply when the
price is | 10.

**Solution:**
Let the x-axis represent the number of units in thousands and the y-axis represent the price in
rupees per unit.

(i) For demand function, let *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* be (22,8)
and (0,30) respectively.
Using two point form, we get the demand function as
\\(\dfrac{y-8}{30-8}=\dfrac{x-22}{0-22}\Rightarrow y_{D}=-x+30\\) (demand function).

Figure 6.29

(ii) For supply function, let *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)* be (0,6) and (24,14)
respectively.

Using two point form, we get the supply function as

\\(\dfrac{y-6}{14-6}=\dfrac{x-0}{24-0}\\) 
\\( y_{S}=\dfrac{1}{3}x+6\\) (supply function).

(iii) At the market equilibrium the demand equals to supply,
That is,\\( y_{D}=y_{S}\Rightarrow -x+30=\dfrac{1}{3}x+6\\) 
\\(x=18\:\:and\:\:y=12\\) 

Market equilibrium price is Rs12 and number of quantity is 18,000 units.
(iv) when the price y = 10, from the demand function yD = −x + 30, we get x = 20.

That is, the demand is 20,000 units.

Similarly from the supply function yS =
\\(y_{S}=\dfrac{1}{3}x+6,\:we \:get\:x=12\\) 

Hence, the supply is 12,000 units.

intercepts, but opposite in signs with the two coordinate axes.

**Solution:**

Let the intercepts cut off from the axes be of lengths a and −a.

∴ Equation of the line is of the form

\\(\dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{a}=1\Rightarrow x-y=a\\)
Since it passes through (−1, 1)
⇒ (−1) − (1) = a ⇒ a = −2.

**Example 6.15** A straight line *L* with negative slope passes through the point (9, 4) cuts the positive coordinate axes at the points *P* and *Q*. As *L* varies, find the minimum value of |*OP*|+|*OQ*|, where *O* is the origin.

**Solution:**
Let *m* be the slope of the line *L*. Since it passes through the point (9, 4) the equation of the line
*L* is *y* − 4 = *m*(*x* − 9).

The points P and Q are respectively
\\((9-\dfrac{4}{m},0)\:\:and\:\:(0,4-9m)\\)
\\((m<0)\begin{vmatrix}

OQ
\end{vmatrix}=\begin{vmatrix}
9-\dfrac{4}{m}
\end{vmatrix}+\begin{vmatrix}
4-9m

\\(=\begin{vmatrix}
9+\dfrac{4}{k}
\end{vmatrix}+\begin{vmatrix}
4+9k
\end{vmatrix}\:\:(m<0,take\:m=-k,k>0)\\)
\\(=(9+\dfrac{4}{k})+(4+9k)\:\:(all\:terms\:are\:positive)\\)
\\(=(4+9)+(\dfrac{4}{k}+9k)\\)
\\(\geq 13+2\sqrt{\dfrac{4}{k}*9k}\:\:(Arithmetic\:mean\:\geq Geometric\:mean)\\)
\\(\begin{vmatrix}
OP
\end{vmatrix}+\begin{vmatrix}
OQ

**Example 6.16** The length of the perpendicular drawn from the origin to a line is 12 and makes an
angle 150◦ with positive direction of the *x*-axis. Find the equation of the line.

**Solution:**
Here, *p* = 12 and *α* = 150◦, So the equation of the required line is of the form

\\(x\cos\alpha+y\sin\alpha=p\\)
\\(That\:is\:x\cos150\degree+y\sin150\degree=12\\)
\\(\Rightarrow \sqrt{3x}-y+24=0\\)

**Example 6.17** Area of the triangle formed by a line with the coordinate axes, is 36 square units.
Find the equation of the line if the perpendicular drawn from the origin to the line makes an angle
of 45◦ with positive the *x*-axis.

**Solution:**

Let *p* be the length of the perpendicular drawn from the origin to the required line.

The perpendicular makes 45◦ with the *x*-axis.

The equation of the required line is of the form,

\\(x\cos \alpha+y\sin\alpha=p\\)

\\(x\cos 45\degree+y\sin45\degree=p\\)

\\(\Rightarrow x+y=\sqrt{2p}\\)

This equation cuts the coordinate axes at A(√2p,0) and B(0,√2p)

Area of the ∆OAB is

\\(\dfrac{1}{2}*\sqrt{2p}*\sqrt{2p}=36\Rightarrow p=6\:\:(\because p\:is\:positive)\\)

Therefore the equation of the required line is
\\(x+y=6\sqrt{2}\\)

**Example 6.18** Find the equation of the lines make an angle 60◦ with positive *x*-axis and at a
distance 5√2 units measured from the point(4, 7), along the line *x − y* + 3 = 0.

**Solution:**

The angle of inclination of the line *x − y* + 3 = 0 is 45◦
, and a point on the line is (4, 7).

Using parametric form

\\(\dfrac{x-x_{1}}{\cos\theta}=\dfrac{y-y_{1}}{\sin\theta}=r,\\)


the above equation can be written as

\\(\dfrac{x-4}{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt2}}=\dfrac{y-7}{\dfrac{1}{\sqrt2}}=\pm 5\sqrt2\:(for\:either\:side\:of\:(4,7)\:at\:a\:distance\:r=\pm 5\sqrt2)\\)

That is \\(x-4=y-7=\pm5\\)
The points on the lines at a distance 5
√
2 units either side of (4, 7) are
(4 + 5, 7 + 5) and (4 − 5, 7 − 5).

The points on the lines are (9, 12) and (−1, 2) and the given slope is m = tan 60◦ =√3.

Therefore the required equations, using slope and a point form, we get

\\(\sqrt{3x}-y+(12-9\sqrt{3})=0\:and\\)
\\(\sqrt{3x}-y+(2+\sqrt{3})=0\\)

**6.3.4 General form to other forms**
*Ax + By + C* = 0, where *A, B* and *C* being real numbers and *A* and *B* cannot be simultaneously
equal to zero, can be expressed in terms of *A, B* and *C8 of the general form into other forms.

(i) Slope and intercept form: (*B* != 0): The given equation can be written as

\\(y=-\dfrac{A}{B}x-\dfrac{C}{B}\Rightarrow slope=-\dfrac{A}{B}\:and\:y-intercept=-\dfrac{C}{B}\\)
(ii) Intercepts form: The given equation can be written as

\\(\dfrac{x}{(-\dfrac{C}{A})}+\dfrac{y}{(-\dfrac{C}{B})}=1\:\:(A,\:B\:and\:C\:are\:all\:non-zero)\\)
Comparing with intercept form, we get

**Example 6.19** Express the equation √3x − y + 4 = 0 in the following equivalent form:

(i) Slope and Intercept form
(ii) Intercept form
(iii) Normal form

**Solution:**
(i) Slope and intercept form
It is given that 
\\(\sqrt{3x}-y+4=0\\)
\\(\Rightarrow y=\sqrt{3x}+4\\)
Comparing the above equation with the equation y = mx + b, we have

\\(Slope\:=\sqrt{3}\:and\:y-intercept=4\\)
(ii) Intercept form
\\(\sqrt{3x}-y+4=0\Rightarrow \sqrt{3x}-y=-4\\)
\\(-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x+\dfrac{y}{4}=1\\)
\\(That\:is\:\dfrac{x}{-\dfrac{4}{\sqrt{3}}}+\dfrac{y}{4}=1\\)

Comparing the above equation with the equation x
\\(\dfrac{x}{a}+\dfrac{y}{b}=1\\)
We get, x-intercept = −4/√3 and y-intercept = 4

(iii) Normal form:
\\(\sqrt{3x}-y+4=0\\)
\\((-\sqrt{3})x+y=4,\\)
Comparing the above equation with the equation Ax + By + C = 0.
Here \\(A=-\sqrt{3},\:andB=1,\sqrt{A^2+B^2}=2\\)
Therefore, dividing the above equation by 2, we get
\\(-\dfrac{\sqrt{3x}}{2}+\dfrac{y}{2}=2\\)
Comparing the above equation with the equation x cos α + y sin α = p

If we take
\\(\cos\alpha=\dfrac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}\:and\:\sin\alpha=\dfrac{1}{2}\:and\:p=2\\)
\\(\Rightarrow \alpha=150\degree=\dfrac{5\pi}{6}\:and\:length\:of\:the\:normal\:(p)=2\\)
The normal form is x cos
\\(x\cos\dfrac{5\pi}{6}+y\sin\dfrac{5\pi}{6}=2\\)
To express the given equation to the required form, some times, it is more convenient
to use property the proportionality of the coefficients of like terms.

Since both represent the same equation, the coefficients are proportional. We get,

\\(\dfrac{\cos\alpha}{-\sqrt{3}}=\dfrac{\sin\alpha}{-1}=\dfrac{p}{4}\\)
\\(\dfrac{\cos\alpha}{-\sqrt{3}}=\dfrac{\sin\alpha}{-1}=\dfrac{p}{4}=\dfrac{\sqrt{\cos^2\alpha+\sin^2\alpha}}{\sqrt{(-\sqrt{3})^2+(-1)^2}}=\dfrac{1}{2}\\)
\\(\cos\alpha=\dfrac{-\sqrt{3}}{2},\:sin\alpha=\dfrac{-1}{2}\:and\:p=\dfrac{4}{2}\\)
\\(\alpha=210\degree=\dfrac{7\pi}{6}\:and\:p=2\\)

____
(In componendo and dividendo,
whenever a term is square off,
then it should be square root off it.)

Normal form of the equation is
\\(x\cos\dfrac{7\pi}{6}+y\sin\dfrac{{7\pi}}{6}=2\\)

Finding the shortest path between two points on a curved surface can often be difficult.
However, the length of a path on the surface of a cylinder is not changed if the curved
surface is flattened. For the following problem, by unrolling the hollow cylinder and
flattening it into a rectangle, a single reflection allows us to determine the ant’s path.
Figure 6.31


**Example 6.21**
Consider a hollow cylindrical vessel, with circumference 24 cm and height
10 cm. An ant is located on the outside of vessel 4 cm from the bottom. There
is a drop of honey at the diagrammatically opposite inside of the vessel, 3 cm
from the top. (i) What is the shortest distance the ant would need to crawl to
get the honey drop?. (ii) Equation of the path traced out by the ant. (iii) Where
the ant enter in to the cylinder?. Here is a picture that illustrates the position
of the ant and the honey.


**Solution:**
By unrolling the hollow cylinder and flattening it into a rectangle, and with a single
reflection allows us to determine the ant’s
path, as shown the figure. Let the base line
x-axis in cm. and the vertical line through A
(initial position of the ant) be the y-axis. Let
H be the position of honey drop and E be the
entry point of ant inside the vessel. From the
given information we have

Let *A(x1, y1)* and *H(x2, y2)* be (0,4) and
(12,13) respectively

Figure 6.32


(i) The shortest distance between A and H is
\\(\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-y_{1})^2}=\sqrt{12^2+9^2}=15\\)
the ant would need to crawl 15 cm to get the honey.

(ii) The equation of the path AH is \\(\dfrac{y-4}{13-4}=\dfrac{x-0}{12-0}\\)
\\(y=0.75x+4\\)
(iii) At the entry point E, y = 10 ⇒ x = 8
\\(E=(8,10)\\)

Taking the orign at different location, different form of equation can be obtained, but
the path and distance are the same as above.
