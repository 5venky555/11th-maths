# Locus of a point

**Definition 6.1**

A **point** is an exact position or location on a plane surface.


It is important to understand that a point is not a thing, but a place. We indicate the position of a point by placing a dot. In plane analytical geometry, points are defined as ordered pairs of real numbers,
say, *(x, y)* with reference to the coordinate system.
Generally, a horizontal line is called the *x*-axis; and the line vertical to the x-axis is called the
*y* -axis. Intersection of these two axes is called the origin. Any point *P* in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers *(x, y)* where *x* gives the distance between the point *P* and the *y* -axis and *y* denote the distance between the point P and the *x*-axis. Note that if *x* is negative it lies left of *y* − axis, similarly if *y* is negative it lies below the *x*-axis. In applications, often letters other than *x* and *y* are used, and different scales are chosen in the horizontal and vertical directions.

**Definition 6.2**

The path traced out by a moving point under certain conditions is called the **locus** of that point.
Alternatively, when a point moves in accordance with a geometrical law, its path is called locus.
The plural of locus is loci.

The following illustrations shows some cases of loci and its different uses.

**Illustration 6.1:** In cricket, when a ball is bowled by a bowler, the path traced out by the ball is the locus of the ball. Whenever there is dispute between batsmen and the fielders for leg before wicket
(LBW) decisions, the locus of the ball
solves the crises, raised by the players
for review, through the third umpire. The
likely path of the ball can be projected
forward, through the batsman’s legs, to
see whether it would have hit the stumps
or not. Consultation of the third umpire,
for conventional slow motion or HawkEye, the probable decision will be taken.
This method is currently sanctioned in
international cricket.

**Illustration 6.2:** Suppose *P* be a point on the rim (circumference) of a circular wheel. When the
circle is rolling without slipping along a straight line, the locus of the point *P* on the rim is shown in
figure. The path traced out by the point *P* is known as cycloid. Try yourself by taking a point inside
the circle. Find the names of the curve from the web site: www.mathworld.wolfram.com

**Illustration 6.3:** A missile is launched from the army ship to attack and another from the land to
intercept it. The loci of the missiles are shown in figure.

Locus of missiles play a vital role in
many wars. During the Gulf War (2
Aug1990-28 Feb 1991), Iraq attacked
Israeli cities with Scud missiles. To
defend from Scud attack, Israel used
Patriot missiles to shoot down enemy
missiles. To launch a satellite or space
shuttle successfully, the determination
of path plays an crucial role in space
research.

An equation in the two variables x and y will ordinarily be satisfied by infinitely many pair of real value of *x* and *y*. Every such pair is called a real solution of the equation. Each real solution of the equation will have its graph. The collection of all these graphs is called the locus of the given
equation.

The following table shows some important loci in mathematics

| A moving point P under the given condition                                 | Graph       | Name of the Path                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A point P moves such that it is equidistant from  two fixed points A and B |  Figure 6.6 | Perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB |
| A point P moves such that it is equidistant from two fixed lines ox and oy |  Figure 6.7 | Angle bisector of the angle xoy               |
| A point P moves equidistant from a fixed point O                           |  Figure 6.8 | Circle   

Now let us discuss the ways of finding the locus of the points. The equation of the locus is the
relation that exists between the coordinates of all the points strictly lying on the path.

**Procedure for finding the equation of the locus of a point**

(i) If we are finding the equation of the locus of a point P, assign coordinates, say *(h, k)* to P

(ii) Express the given conditions as equations in terms of the known quantities and unknown parameters.

(iii) Eliminate the parameters, so that the resulting equation contains only *h, k* and known quantities.

(iv) Replace *h* by *x*, and *k* by *y*, in the resulting equation. The resulting equation is the equation of
the locus of point *P*.

**Example 6.1** Find the locus of a point which moves such that its distance from the *x*-axis is equal
to the distance from the *y*-axis.

**Solution:**

Let *P (h, k)* be a point on the locus.

Let *A* and *B* be the foot of the perpendiculars drawn
from the point P on the *x*-axis and the *y*-axis respectively.

Therefore *P* is *(OA, OB)* = *(BP, AP)* = *(h, k)*
Given that *AP* = *BP*

⇒ *k* = *h*

replacing *h* and *k* by substituting *h* = *x* and *k* = *y*
The locus of *P* is, *y* = *x* , is a line passing through the
origin


Figure 6.9

**Example 6.2** Find the path traced out by the point 
(ct,c/t), here *t* != 0 is the parameter and *c* is a
constant

**Solution:**
Let *P (h, k)* be a point on the locus. From the given information, we have *h* = *ct* and *k* = *c/t*. To eliminate *t*, taking product of these two equations

\\((h) (k) = (ct)(c/t)⇒ hk = c2 \\)


Therefore, the required locus is *xy = c\\(_2\\)*

**Example 6.3** Find the locus of a point P moves such that its distances from two fixed points
*A* (1, 0) and *B* (5, 0), are always equal.

**Solution:**
Given that *A* (1, 0) and *B* (5, 0)

Let *P (h, k)* be any point on the required path.

From the information we have *AP* = *BP*

That is

\\(\sqrt[]{(h-1)^{2}+(k-0)^2} = \sqrt[]{(h-5)^{2}+(k-0)^2}\Rightarrow h=3\\)

Therefore the locus of *P* is *x* = 3, which is a straight line parallel to the *y*-axis.


Figure 6.10

**Example 6.4** If *θ* is a parameter, find the equation of the locus of a moving point, whose coordinates
are *(a sec θ, b tan θ)*.

**Solution:**
Let *P (h, k)* be any point on the required path. From the given information we have

\\(h = a secθ and k = b tanθ\\)
\\(⇒\frac{h}{a}=secθ and \frac{k}{b}=tanθ\\)


To eliminate the parameter *θ*, squaring and subtracting, we get

\\(\frac{h}{a}^2-\frac{k}{b}^2=\sec ^2\theta -\tan ^2\theta \\)

\\(\frac{h}{a}^2-\frac{k}{b}^2=1\\)


Therefore the locus of the given point is

\\(\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\\)

Whenever the parameters are in trigonometric form, try to use trigonometric identities to eliminate *θ*

sin\\(_2\\)
θ + cos\\(_2\\)
θ = 1, sec\\(_2\\)
θ − tan\\(_2\\)
θ = 1, cosec\\(_2\\)
θ − cot\\(_2\\)
θ = 1.


**Example 6.5** A straight rod of the length 6 units, slides with its ends *A* and *B* always on the x and
y axes respectively. If *O* is the origin, then find the locus of the centroid of *∆OAB* .

**Solution:**
Let the coordinates of the points *O*, *A* and *B*
are *(0, 0), (a, 0)* and *(0, b)* respectively.

Observed that the points *A* and *B* are moving points.

Let *(h, k)* be a centroid of *∆OAB*.

Centroid of *∆OAB* is

\\(\frac{0+a+0}{3},\frac{0+0+b}{3}=(h,k)\\)

\\(\frac{a}{3}=h\Rightarrow a=3h, \frac{b}{3}=k\Rightarrow b=3k\\)

From right *∆OAB,   OA\\(_2\\) + OB\\(_2\\) = AB\\(_2\\)*

\\((3h)^2 + (3k)^2 = (6)^2> ⇒ h^2 + k^2 = 4\\)

Locus of *(h, k)* is a circle, *x*\\(_2\\) + y\\(_2\\) = 4.

Figure 6.11


**Example 6.6** If *θ* is a parameter, find the equation of the locus of a moving point, whose coordinates
are *(a(θ − sin θ), a(1 − cos θ))*.

**Solution:**
Let *P (h, k)* be any point on the required
path. From the given information we have

\\(h=a(\theta -\sin \theta )\\)
\\(k=a(1 -\cos \theta )\\)

Figure 6.12

Let us find the value of *θ* and *sin θ* from equation (6.2)

\\(k=a(1 -\cos \theta )\\)
\\(\cos \theta = \frac{a-k}{a}\Rightarrow \theta = \cos^{-1}\frac{a-k}{a} , \sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2ak-k^2}}{a}\\)

Substituting above values in (6.1) we get *h* = a cos−1

\\(h = \cos^{-1}\frac{a-k}{a} - \sqrt{2ak-k^2}\\)

The locus of *(h, k)* is

\\(x = a\cos^{-1}\frac{a-y}{a} - \sqrt{2ay-y^2}\\)

Though, the parametric form given above is converted to Cartesian form, in some cases
the parametric form may be more useful to work with than the cartesian form.
