# 5 Properties of Integrals

(1) If k is any constant, then kf (x) dx = k  f(x) dx
(2) ( ( f x)+ ( f x))dx =f (x) (x) dx f x dx
The above two properties can be combined and extended as

That is, the integration of the linear combination of a finite number of functions is equal to the
linear combination of their integrals
In elementary geometry we have learnt to evaluate the measure of the following regular shape of
the figures given below by using known formulae.

How can the measure of the following figures given by functions be calculated?
Though the problems look so difficult, integral calculus solves it without any difficulties.

**Solution 3** 

 At a particular moment, a student needs to stop his speedy bike
to avoid a collision with the barrier ahead at a distance 40 metres
away from him. Immediately he slows (acceleration) down the bike
applying brake at a rate of 2 8 meter/second . If the bike is moving
at a speed of 24m/s, when the brakes are applied, will it stop before
collision?
Also look at the following problems that occur naturally in our
life.

♦ What speed has to be applied to fire a satellite upward so that it never returns to the earth?
♦ What is the radius of the smallest circular disk that can cover every isosceles triangle of given
perimeter P?
♦ What volume of material is removed from a solid sphere of radius 2r if a hole of radius r is
drilled through the centre?
♦ If a strain of bacteria grows at a rate proportional to the amount present and if the population
doubles in one hour, how much will it increase at the end of two hours?
Integration will answer for all the above problems.

**Learning Objectives**

On completion of this chapter, the students are expected to
• understand the definition of an indefinite integral as a result of reversing the process of
differentiation
• find the indefinite integrals of sums, differences and constant multiples of certain elementary
functions.
• use the appropriate techniques to find the indefinite integrals of composite functions.
• apply integration to find the function, when the rate of change of function is given.
