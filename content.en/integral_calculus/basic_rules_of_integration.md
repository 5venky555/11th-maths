# 3 Basic Rules of Integration

**Standard results**

Since integration is the reverse process of differentiation, the basic integration formulae given
below can be derived directly from their corresponding derivative formulae from earlier chapter.

| Derivatives | Antiderivatives |
|------|------|
| dx/dy (C)=0 , where c is a constant | ∫0dx=c , where c is a constant |
|d/d(x)(kx) =k, where k is a constant | ∫k dx = kx+c , where c is a constant|
|d/dx(logx)=(1/x)|∫1/x dx=logx+c|
|d/dx (-cosx) = sinx|∫sinx dx =-cos x+c|
|d/dx (sinx)= cosx|∫cosx dx=sinx+c|
|d/dx (tanx)= secx|∫secx dx=tanx +c|
