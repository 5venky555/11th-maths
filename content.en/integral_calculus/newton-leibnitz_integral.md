# 2 Newton-Leibnitz Integral

Integral calculus is mainly divided into indefinite integrals and definite integrals. In this chapter,
we study indefinite integration, the process of obtaining a function from its derivative.
We are already familiar with inverse operations.
Similarly differentiation and integrations ( d , ∫ )  are also inverse operations. In this section
we develop the inverse operation of differentiation called ‘antidifferentiation’.

Definition 11.1
A function F (x)is called an antiderivative (Newton-Leibnitz integral or primitive) of a
function f (x) on an interval I if
 F'(x) f(x) = , for every value of x in I


**Theorem 11.1**

  If F(x) is a particular antiderivative of a function f(x) on an interval I, then every
antiderivative of f(x) on I is given by
   ∫f(x)dx=F(x)+c
  where c is called an arbitrary constant, and all antiderivatives of f x( ) on I can be obtained
by assigning particular value to c.
The function f(x) is called Integrand.
The variable x in dx is called variable of integration or integrator.
The process of finding the integral is called integration or antidifferentiation (Newton-Leibnitz
integral).
The peculiar integral sign ∫ originates in an elongated S (likeΣ ) which stands for sum.
Often in applications involving differentiation it is desired to find a particular integral antiderivative
that satisfies certain conditions called initial condition or boundary conditions.
For instance, if an equation involving dy/dx is given as well as the initial condition that
y = y when x = x , then after the set of all antiderivatives is found, if x and y are replaced by
x and y and , a particular value of the arbitrary constant is determined. With this value of c a particular antiderivative is obtained.
