# 4 Integrals of the form f

**EXERCISE 11.4**

(1) If f(x) F'(x) 4 5 and (2) 1, = âˆ’ = find f x( ).
(2) If 2 f(x) F'(x) 9 6 and (0) 3, = âˆ’ = âˆ’ find f x( ).
(3) If fx x f â€²â€²( ) 12 6 and (1) 30, =âˆ’ = f â€²(1) 5 = find f x( ).

It is clear that whenever a constant is added or subtracted with the independent variable x, the
fundamental formulae remain the same.

Here, if any constant is multiplied with the independent variable x, then the same fundamental
formula can be used after dividing it by the coefficient of x
That is, if f x dx g x c f then ax b dx

The above formula can also be derived by using substitution method, which will be studied later

Illustration 11.1
If 2 Fx x ( ) = + 5 then
 Fx x â€²() 2 = .
 Thus if f x( ) is defined by
 fx x () 2, = then
we say that f x( ) is the derivative of F x( ) and that F x( ) is
an antiderivative of f x( )
Consider the following table
F x( ) Fx fx â€²() () = Antiderivative of fx x () 2 =
2 Px x ( ) = + 0
2 Qx x ( ) = + 2
2 Hx x ( ) = âˆ’1
Px x â€²() 2 =
Qx x â€²() 2 = fx x () 2 =
Hx x â€²() 2 =
 2 Fx x ( ) = + ?
We can see that the derivative of F x( ), P x( ),Q x( ) and H x( ) is f x( ) , but in reverse the
antiderivatives of fx x () 2 = is not unique. That is the antiderivatives of f x( ) is a family of infinitely
many functions.

and the initial condition that y x = = 10 when 2.
From the given equation
2 dy x
dx =
 y x dx = 2âˆ«
 2
yx c = +
We substitute y x = = 10 when 2 , in the above equation
 2 10 2 =+â‡’= c c 6
When this value c =6 is substituted we obtain
 2
y x = + 6
 which gives the particular antiderivative desired.
