# 1 Introduction
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716) and
Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) independently
discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. Leibnitz,
a German philosopher, mathematician, and political
adviser, importantly both as a metaphysician and as
a logician, was a distinguished independent inventor
of the Differential and Integral Calculus. Sir Isaac
Newton had created an expression for the area under a
curve by considering a momentary increase at a point.
In effect, the fundamental theorem of calculus was built
into his calculations. His work and discoveries were not limited to mathematics; he also developed
theories in optics and gravitation.
One cannot imagine a world without differentiation and integration. In this century, we witnessed
remarkable scientific advancement owing to the ingenious application of these two basic components
of Mathematics. Calculus serve as unavoidable tool for finding solutions to the variety of problems
that arise in physics, astronomy, engineering, chemistry, geology, biology, and social sciences.

Calculus deals principally with two geometric problems.
(i) The problem of finding SLOPE of the tangent line to the curve, is studied by the limiting
process known as differentiation and
(ii) Problem of finding the AREA of a region under a curve is studied by another limiting process
called Integration.
In chapters 9 and 10, we have studied the differential calculus. In this chapter let us study some
fundamentals of integration.
Consider some simple situations illustrated below.


**Solution**

The shortest distance between two points A and B in a plane is the line segment joining the straight
line A and B. Suppose it is required to find the line connecting two points A and B that do not lie
on a vertical line such that a moving particle slides down on this line from A to B in the shortest
time (minimum time). Most of us believe that the shortest distance path in Fig. 11.1(a) will take the shortest time.

Certainly this route is not the shortest time route joining the points A and B, because the velocity
of the motion in the straight line (Fig. 11.1(a)) will be comparatively slow; whereas it take a curve
that is steeper near A (Fig. 11.1(b)), even though the path becomes longer, a considerable portion of
the distance will be covered at a greater speed. The solution to this problem is solved by Integral
calculus. This is called Brachistochrone problem which initiates the study of calculus of variation
using integral tool.

**Solution 2**

In elementary geometry we have learnt to evaluate the measure of the following regular shape of
the figures given below by using known formulae.

How can the measure of the following figures given by functions be calculated?
Though the problems look so difficult, integral calculus solves it without any difficulties.

**Solution 3** 

 At a particular moment, a student needs to stop his speedy bike
to avoid a collision with the barrier ahead at a distance 40 metres
away from him. Immediately he slows (acceleration) down the bike
applying brake at a rate of 2 8 meter/second . If the bike is moving
at a speed of 24m/s, when the brakes are applied, will it stop before
collision?
Also look at the following problems that occur naturally in our
life.

♦ What speed has to be applied to fire a satellite upward so that it never returns to the earth?
♦ What is the radius of the smallest circular disk that can cover every isosceles triangle of given
perimeter P?
♦ What volume of material is removed from a solid sphere of radius 2r if a hole of radius r is
drilled through the centre?
♦ If a strain of bacteria grows at a rate proportional to the amount present and if the population
doubles in one hour, how much will it increase at the end of two hours?
Integration will answer for all the above problems.

**Learning Objectives**

On completion of this chapter, the students are expected to
• understand the definition of an indefinite integral as a result of reversing the process of
differentiation
• find the indefinite integrals of sums, differences and constant multiples of certain elementary
functions.
• use the appropriate techniques to find the indefinite integrals of composite functions.
• apply integration to find the function, when the rate of change of function is given.
