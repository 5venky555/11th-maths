## Scalars and Vectors

---
**Definition 8.1**

A scalar is a quantity that is determined by its magnitude.

---

For instance, distance, length, speed, temperature, voltage, mass, pressure, and work are scalars.

---
**Definition 8.2**

A vector is a quantity that is determined by both its magnitude and its direction and hence it is
a directed line segment. 

---

For instance, force, displacement, and velocity (which gives the speed and direction of the motion) are vectors. 
We denote vectors by lower case letters with arrow. A two dimensional vector is a directed line
segment in \\(\R ^2\\) and a three dimensional vector is a directed line segment in \\(\R ^3\\).
