# Resolution of Vectors

Resolution of a vector can be done for any finite dimension. But we will discuss only in two and 
three dimensions. Let us start with two dimension.

# Theorem 8.5
Let {{<katex>}}(\overrightarrow{i}{j}) and be the unit vectors along the positive x-axis and the y-axis having initial point at 
the origin O.
